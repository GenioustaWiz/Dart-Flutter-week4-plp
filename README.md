##Dart Programming Demo

This repository contains a simple Dart program that demonstrates various features of the language, including `string manipulation`, `collections (lists, sets, and maps)`, `file handling`, and `date and time utilities`.

#String Manipulation

The program demonstrates string concatenation, interpolation, substring extraction, and case conversion (upper/lowercase). It also shows how to reverse a string and count its length.

#Collections

The program creates and manipulates lists, sets, and maps. It includes operations like adding, removing, and iterating over items. It also showcases scenarios where each collection type is most appropriate.

#File Handling

The program reads content from a file named input.txt and writes new data into another file named output.txt. It demonstrates how to handle errors during file operations.

#Date and Time

The program uses Dart's DateTime class to format, parse, and manipulate dates. It shows how to add/subtract days and calculate the difference between two dates.

#Usage

To run the program, simply execute the main() function. It will perform string manipulation on a hardcoded string, create and manipulate collections, read and write files, and perform date and time operations.
